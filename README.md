# -07-2D-Platformer

# Hi.


so, this is my crappy 2D platformer game.

in the second level, there's a wall near the portal that a slime/you can pass through when you hop behind the portal and try to go through it. however, you cannot go through the wall if you're approaching it from the right side. This is intentional. So you can only go through it if you're already up on the platform with the portal.

You can also sink through some of the square platforms, which was a strange error at first, and so I used slopes as a way to correct this. Then I saw an opportunity to make this kinda work, so on the second level, the two platforms leading up to the exit, you'll sorta "sink" through them, which is meant to throw off the player a bit. I promise you this is not me being lazy and trying to avoid debugging, this is intentional.
